Poisson_2d.f90 is the main program.

Mode_1.f90 is the module file which contains the constants which doesnt change thorught the program.

Mode_2.f90 is the second module file which contains all the subroutines i.e. for each subroutine for Jacobi, Gauss-Siedel and Gauss-Siedel with relaxations method.

This program stores the data in to four files.

1st file (unit=77)= data for step-size and the required no of iterations reqired for convergence for each method.

2nd,3rd,4th file(unit=78,79,80) = data for each step size and the norm1 and norm2 corrosponding to each step size and each different method.

Finally we plot the step size against the norm2 for each differnet method, so we have 3 diff graphs.
